                paragraph: [`1.When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political 
bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the 
separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s Goden title them, a decent respect 
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the 
separation.`, `2. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their 
Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of 
Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed,—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive 
of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its 
powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, 
indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient 
causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils
are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a 
long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them 
under
absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new 
Guards for their future security.—Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now 
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the 
present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object 
the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a 
candid world.`, `3.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has 
forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their 
operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to 
them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those 
people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and 
formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and 
distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance 
with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness 
his invasions on the rights of the people.`],
